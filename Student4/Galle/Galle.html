        <br>
        <p>Galle Fort, in the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese, then extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century from 1649 onwards. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument, which even after more than 432 years maintains a polished appearance, due to extensive reconstruction work done by Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka.

            The fort has a colourful history, and today has a multi-ethnic and multi-religious population. The Sri Lankan government and many Dutch people who still own some of the properties inside the fort are looking at making this one of the modern wonders of the world. The heritage value of the fort has been recognized by the UNESCO and the site has been inscribed as a cultural heritage UNESCO World Heritage Site under criteria iv, for its unique exposition of "an urban ensemble which illustrates the interaction of European architecture and South Asian traditions from the 16th to the 19th centuries."
            
            The Galle Fort, also known as the Dutch Fort or the "Ramparts of Galle", withstood the Boxing Day tsunami which damaged part of coastal area Galle town. It has since been restored.</p>

        <p>Philippus Baldaeus, a Dutch minister who served in the area in the late 1650s, detailed his observations of Galle Harbour, in his work, A True and Exact Description of the most Celebrated East-India Coasts of Malabar and Coromandel and also of the isle of Ceylon (1672), stating that there was an iron cannon placed on the ramparts and a lantern to guide the sailors on top of the 28 feet above sea level rock which jutted out into the sea.

            The first lighthouse at Galle was built by the British in 1848. It was a 24.4 m-high (80 ft) iron lighthouse, constructed from cast-iron plates, imported from England, designed by British architect Alexander Gordon and erected by Messrs. Robinson, Engineers of Pimlico. The lighthouse, painted white, was located on the southwest bastion (the Utrecht Bastion) of Galle Fort on the western side of Galle Harbor. It had a fixed point light with prolate reflectors, which was visible for 19 km (12 mi). In July 1936 it was destroyed by fire.
            
            The current 26.5 m-high (87 ft) concrete lighthouse was erected by the British about 100 m (330 ft) from the original site in 1939. The original light was furnished with a glass prism lens floating in a bath of mercury (to reduce friction) and was powered by a weight driven machine.[citation needed]
            
            The light station is within the walls of the ancient Galle Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and well known tourist attraction. The lighthouse is strategically located at the southern end of the promontory, built approximately 6 m (20 ft) above the road level on the ramparts, at what is known as the Point Utrecht Bastion, giving it full view of any ships entering Galle Harbour.</p>

        <h2>All Saints' Church, Galle</h2>

        <br>
        <p>The decision to build an Anglican church at Galle, was initiated by the first Bishop of Colombo, Rt. Rev. James Chapman. The foundation of the church was laid on 30 October 1868, by Rev. Dr. Piers Calveley Claughton, the second Bishop of Colombo. The construction of the church was facilitated by a grant of the land and £600 from the 13th Governor of Ceylon, Sir Hercules Robinson. A further £1,000 contribution was received from an English parish. The church was designed by James George Smither, the government architect, who later designed the National Museum of Colombo. The church was constructed on the site of a former Court House (1780s). The gallows it is said stood on the site of the present altar. The Anglican congregation in Galle which, up to then, worshipped in the Dutch Church. The church was consecrated on 21 February 1871 by Bishop Claughton, assisted by the church's first vicar, Rev. Dr. George Justus Schrader (1829-1875).

            In recognition of Rev. Dr. Schrader's significant contribution to the church, a large bell was placed in his memory in the centre dome of the church in 1876. In the mid 1960s, for security reasons the bell was lowered and was left to be sold. It was subsequently bought by the diocese and is now housed in the Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour in Colombo. The current bell was acquired by the church in 1968. The bell came from the Liberty Ship, "Ocean Verity", and was donated by the Clan Line Steamship Company.
            
            The first Baptism at All Saints was Lilian Slade Godolphin Ozanne on 21 February 1871 and the first marriage was held on 25 March 1871, between James Weir and Jane Strene King.</p>
