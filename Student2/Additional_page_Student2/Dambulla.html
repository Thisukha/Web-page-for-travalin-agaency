                        <p>
                            Dambulla holds a significant place in Sri Lanka's history,
                            with evidence of human habitation dating back over 2,500 years.
                            It was during the reign of King Valagamba (1st century BCE) that Dambulla reached its
                            prominence.
                            Fleeing from foreign invaders, the exiled king sought refuge in the region,
                            and it was here that he constructed the magnificent Dambulla Cave Temples.
                            These temples not only served as a place of worship but also as a sanctuary for the king and
                            his followers during troubled times.
